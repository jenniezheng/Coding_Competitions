# Code
A collection of code I've wrote for coding challenges and algorithm practice.

### Note On Quality:
 - I've written most of these code pieces under a 20 minutes, so they are not exactly my best work. I don't follow solid coding practices when I'm under a tight time pressure.
 - For slightly higher quality code, check out the hackerrank folder. Those are  practice pieces, so in general they cover more difficult topics and are more cleanly written.

### Preferred languages:
 - Python for awesome libraries like matplotlib and convenient data structure outputting
 - C++ for pointers and speed

### Favorite Competitions:
 - I appreciate Leetcode for its consistent and convenient 6pm Saturday start times. Their problems are a bit on the easy side, though.
 - I respect codeforces but can't keep up with their varying competition times which target people all over the global. I'm either sleeping or in class for most of their start times, so I generally don't participate in codeforce rounds.
